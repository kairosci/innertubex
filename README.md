InnerTubeX is an extended Android and JVM Kotlin Multiplatform client for
YouTube's InnerTube APIs. It retains standard browse, search, account,
playlist, and player operations while adding:

- SABR/UMP audio and video streaming with seekable segmented sources.
- SABR video representation selection for host video playback.
- Player cipher deobfuscation through Zemer, Faraday, EJS, and QuickJS.
- Layered remote, parsed-script, and cached cipher fallbacks.
- Isolated authenticated sessions with generation-safe cancellation.
- Channel discovery, account switching support, and streaming music uploads.
- Bounded remote bodies and protocol state with strict media URL validation.
- Injectable logging, player configuration, diagnostics, and token providers.

## Install

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io") {
        content { includeGroup("com.github.MetrolistGroup.innertubex") }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.MetrolistGroup.innertubex:innertubex:v0.1.1")
}
```

## Minimal Usage

```kotlin
val client = InnerTube(
    httpClient = HttpClient(OkHttp),
    locale = YouTubeLocale(
        hl = Locale.getDefault().toLanguageTag(),
        gl = Locale.getDefault().country,
    ),
)

val response = client.search("query").body<SearchResponse>()
client.close()
```

The caller owns the supplied `HttpClient`. `InnerTube.close()` cancels only
library-owned visitor-data work and session-bound requests. Authenticated
sessions contain sensitive cookies and SAPISID values; follow
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) when storing or logging them.

## Development

```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat
./gradlew allTests ktlintCheck apiCheck assemble
```

Enable the repository hook with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Status

InnerTubeX uses experimental `0.x` versioning. YouTube can change private APIs,
player scripts, and SABR behavior without notice, so pin exact versions and
review [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.
