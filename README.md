InnerTubeX is an extended Android and JVM Kotlin Multiplatform client for
YouTube's InnerTube APIs. It retains standard browse, search, account,
playlist, and player operations while adding:

- SABR/UMP audio and video streaming with seekable segmented sources.
- SABR video representation selection for host video playback.
- Player cipher deobfuscation through Zemer, Faraday, EJS, and QuickJS.
- Layered remote, parsed-script, and cached cipher fallbacks.
- Isolated authenticated sessions with generation-safe cancellation.
- Channel discovery, account switching support, and streaming music uploads.
- Bounded remote bodies and protocol state with strict media URL validation.
- Injectable logging, player configuration, diagnostics, and token providers.

## Install

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://jitpack.io") {
        content { includeGroup("com.github.MetrolistGroup.innertubex") }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.MetrolistGroup.innertubex:innertubex:v0.3.0")
}
```

## Minimal Usage

```kotlin
val client = InnerTube(
    httpClient = HttpClient(OkHttp),
)

val response = client.search(YouTubeClient.WEB, query = "query").body<SearchResponse>()
client.close()
```

The caller owns the supplied `HttpClient`. `InnerTube.close()` cancels only
library-owned visitor-data work and session-bound requests. Authenticated
sessions contain sensitive cookies and SAPISID values; follow
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) when storing or logging them.

## Stream Extraction

The reusable extraction stack handles client selection, player configuration,
cipher transforms, PO-token contracts, direct/HLS/SABR transport selection,
format selection, and bounded media probing:

```kotlin
val configStore = RemotePlayerConfigStore(
    httpClient = client.httpClient,
    repository = PlayerConfigRepository.disabled(),
)
val cipher = YouTubeCipherService(client.httpClient, configStore)
val extractor: StreamExtractor = InnerTubeExtractor(
    configParser = YtConfigParserImpl(client.httpClient, client, configStore),
    cipherService = cipher,
    innerTube = client,
)

val stream = extractor.extract(
    videoId = "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    hints = ContentHints(wantVideo = false),
    audioQuality = AudioQuality.HIGH,
)
```

Applications can inject `TokenProvider`, `ClientHealthMonitor`,
`ClientFallbackStrategy`, and `InnerTubeLogger` implementations. Platform token
minting, persistence, playback engines, UI, and application settings remain
host-owned. Never log an `ExtractedStream`, PO-token values, signed URLs, or
authenticated session fields; library model `toString()` implementations redact
those values as defense in depth.

## Development

```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat
./gradlew allTests ktlintCheck apiCheck assemble publishToMavenLocal
```

## Status

InnerTubeX uses experimental `0.x` versioning. YouTube can change private APIs,
player scripts, and SABR behavior without notice, so pin exact versions and
review [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.
